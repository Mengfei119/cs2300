# SQL Join Problems

## Activity 1. Students and Jobs

- The **students** table is a list of students enrolled at School 2300. Information includes their name and year.
- The **majors** table is a list of majors at School 2300.
- The **jobs** table is a list of positions at 2300 Company where they are willing to let students shadow. They have a recommended major for each position.

### a) List all students and their respective majors (include undeclared, meaning NULL, majors).

*This information is stored in several different tables so we need to JOIN the tables to put the information together.*

1. What tables do you need? Put an x between the `[x]`.

    - [x] students
    - [x] majors
    - [ ] jobs

    *All of these tables hold some valuable information, but for this query, we specifically need the tables that have student names and on majors.*

2. Which table should be your *left* table? Which table should be your *right* table?

    - Left Table: students
    - Right Table: majors

3. What type of join do you need? Put an x between the `[x]`.

    *Think about if you care if values from your left, right, or both tables are NULL.*

    - [ ] INNER JOIN
    - [x] LEFT OUTER JOIN

4. What fields do you need?

    *Think about the primary and foreign keys we can use to JOIN the tables.*
    *Think about the field we want in our result.*
    The result only shows the first_name, last_name of students table and major of majors table
    But actually I need id, first_name, last_name and majors_id fields in students table and id, major in majors table.
    primary key: students.id
    foreign key: majors.id (majors.id = students.major_id)


5. Write the SQL query and execute the query to test it in DB Browser for SQLite.

    ```sql
    SELECT students.first_name, students.last_name, majors.major FROM students LEFT OUTER JOIN majors ON students.major_id = majors.id;
    ```

    You should get the following result:
    |     | first_name | last_name | major               |
    | --- | ---------- | --------- | ------------------- |
    | 1   | John       | Piper     | *NULL*              |
    | 2   | Kailey     | Madison   | Information Science |
    | 3   | Savannah   | Kelly     | Computer Science    |
    | .   | ...        | ...       | ...                 |
    ...
    with 16 rows total.


### b) List the students and all of their job matches, if any.

1. What tables do you need? Put an x between the `[x]`.

    - [x] students
    - [ ] majors
    - [x] jobs

2. Which table should be your *left* table? Which table should be your *right* table?

    - Left Table: students
    - Right Table: jobs

3. What type of join do you need? Put an x between the `[x]`.

    *Think about if you care if values from your left, right, or both tables are NULL.*

    - [ ] INNER JOIN
    - [x] LEFT OUTER JOIN

4. What fields do you need?
The result shows the id, first_name, last_name of students table and positions of jobs table.
And actually I need id, first_name, last_name and major_id of students table and positions, major_id of jobs table.
primary key: students.id
foreign key: major_id (students.major_id = jobs.major_id)


5. Write the SQL query and execute the query to test it in DB Browser for SQLite.

    ```sql
    SELECT students.first_name, students.last_name, jobs.position FROM students LEFT OUTER JOIN jobs ON students.major_id = jobs.major_id;
    ```

    You should get the following result:
    |     | first_name | last_name | position          |
    | --- | ---------- | --------- | ----------------- |
    | 1   | John       | Piper     | *NULL*            |
    | 2   | Kailey     | Madison   | Data Scientist    |
    | 3   | Kailey     | Madison   | User Experience   |
    | 4   | Savannah   | Kelly     | Software Engineer |
    | 5   | Savannah   | Kelly     | Test Engineer     |
    | .   | ...        | ...       | ...               |
    ...
    with 24 rows total.


### c) List all the position that are matched with majors.

1. What tables do you need? Put an x between the `[x]`.

    - [ ] students
    - [x] majors
    - [x] jobs

2. Which table should be your *left* table? Which table should be your *right* table?

    - Left Table: jobs
    - Right Table: majors

3. What type of join do you need? Put an x between the `[x]`.

    *Think about if you care if values from your left, right, or both tables are NULL.*

    - [x] INNER JOIN
    - [ ] LEFT OUTER JOIN

4. What fields do you need?
Show position of jobs table and major of majors table.
Actually I need id, position, major_id of position table and id and major of majors table.
Primary key: jobs.id
Foreign key: major_id(jobs.major_id = majors.id)


5. Write the SQL query and execute the query to test it in DB Browser for SQLite.

    ```sql
    SELECT jobs.position, majors.major FROM jobs INNER JOIN majors ON jobs.major_id = majors.id;
    ```

    You should get the following result:
    |     | position          | major               |
    | --- | ----------------- | ------------------- |
    | 1   | Software Engineer | Computer Science    |
    | 2   | User Experience   | Information Science |
    | 3   | Data Scientist    | Information Science |
