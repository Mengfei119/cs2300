# Cognitive Walkthrough Evaluation

## Personas

1. Briefly describe **Abby**'s motivations, attitudes, how she works with technology and learns.

    [1-2 sentences]
    Her job requires her to learn new technologies and she learns it when she needs.
    Abby is familiar with technologies and she learns by process

2. How does **Tim**'s motivations, attitudes, how he works with technology and learns _differ_ from Abby's.

    [2-3 sentences]
    Tim is interested in new technologies in his spare time and he doesn't mind to take extra time to explore the new things. He's in high confidence and he learns by tinkering and exploring

3. How does **Pat**'s (Patricia or Patrick) motivations, attitudes, how she works with technology and learns _compare_ to Abby's and Tim's.

    [2-3 sentences]
    He learns technology when he needs to and he does not want to take much risks as Abby. He learns more by process.

4. Which persona feels the most like the _opposite_ of your own technological problem solving styles?

    [Abby, Pat, Tim]
    Abby

2. What inclusiveness bugs did you discover?
 the check box for each creature with unclear defination

3. Propose a few ideas how to address these issues.
Show instructions on how to do things on the top of the page or beside the forms.
